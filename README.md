## About Me

Hi! 

My name is Vincent T. Wang, and I’m from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to CMU, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science with a minor in History from UC Davis. My professional experience includes working as a Revenue Officer for the Internal Revenue Service and holding several roles within the San Francisco Department of Elections. At the IRS, I chased down the debts of people who borrowed money from the government like a debt-detective on a mission to find the world’s most elusive hide-and-seek champions. During the summer of my master’s program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), focusing on cybersecurity policy and combating disinformation on social media. 
I love cooking, reading, hiking, running weightlifting. Honestly, I love eating the most. People tell me that I have an addiction to sparkling water, but I don't think its a problem... I can quit anytime I want! Sparkling water is not my replacement for regular water, I promise! Honestly, I just love learning! 
I've gained a strong foundation data science throughout my studies, but I know that it is often challenging to communicate these concepts to those who don’t have the same technical background. Effective communication is crucial for conveying information clearly and ensuring it is understood by all parties, regardless of their background or expertise. Thats why I am taking this class!

For the future, I hope to be a policy analyst or work within the data privacy sector.

## What I Hope To Learn
Through this data visualization course, I aim to enhance my ability to design compelling visual narratives that effectively communicate and persuade my audience. While I currently rely on creating various graphs in R and Python, I feel that this is not enough to meet my career goal of becoming a public policy analyst who can inspire others to adopt evidence-based thinking and trust in my analysis.

I want to:
1. Learn to present complex data in a way that is easy to understand.
2. Learn to present data honestly without misleading or misrepresenting it.
3. Obtain all the necessary skills to ensure that my visualizations have the power to make some change (no matter how small it is)
